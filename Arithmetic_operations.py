#operators
#arithmetic operators-Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. For example,
#Here, - is an arithmetic operator that subtracts two values or variables.


#assignment operators-Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. For example,
#Here, = is an assignment operator that assigns 5 to x.


#comparison operators-Comparison operators compare two values/variables and return a boolean result: True or False.

#logical operators- Since both a > 2 and b >= 6 are True, the result is True.

#bitwise operators-Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits. They operate bit by bit, hence the name.
#For example, 2 is 10 in binary and 7 is 111

#identity operators-is and is not being used to check if two values are located on the same part of the memory. Two equal variables do not imply that they are identical.eg;is True-x is True is not True x is not true

#membership operators-In Python, in and not in are the membership operators. 
#They are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set, and dictionary).
#In a dictionary, we can only test for the presence of a key, not the value.eg;Here, 'H' is in x but 'hello' is not present in x (remember, Python is case-sensitive).
